# SpaceBattle
My learning project
## Description
This is a learning project I have been wroking on for nine months already, that serves a purely educational role. I created it to improve my practical JavaScript skills. The project is written in clear JS because I decided that before moving on to TypeScript and React.js, I needed a deeper understanding of the language.

Space Battle is a game inspired by the classic game **Space Invaders**. I am aware the code is not perfect, but that is the point. This is a work-in-progress project that evolves as I learn more. It has already done that because, at the moment, it is nine months (already?!) since I began working on it. In that time, I have learned a lot, but I realize there is still a lot more to learn. Like, for example, how to use GIT and GitHub, which is why I decided to move this project here. This repository is public because it might help other people learn too.
